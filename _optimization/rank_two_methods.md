To overcome [[rank_one_method#Difficulties in rank one]] we have rank 2

$$B^{k+1} = B^k +\alpha vv^T +\beta vv^T$$

 The two ways to update are [[bfs_davidon_fletcher_powell_]] and  [[bgfs_broyden_fletcher_goldfarb_shanno_]]. They are **dual** to each other. Combining them gives rise to **Broyden Family** . BGFS works well than BFS.
