# determinant

Fix an oriented unit [[pseudoscalar]] $I_n$. An [[outermorphism]] preserves grade, so the image of $I_n$ must be another pseudoscalar and therefore a scalar multiple of $I_n$.
$$
f[I_n] = \det(f) \, I_n.
$$
This defines $\det(f)$ coordinate-free as the signed scale factor of oriented $n$-volume.

Standard identities follow directly from this definition. Composition gives $\det(g \circ f) = \det(g)\det(f)$ because applying $f$ then $g$ to $I_n$ pulls out both scalars. A rotation preserves oriented volume, so $\det = +1$. A point reflection negates every vector, so an $n$-blade picks up $(-1)^n$ and orientation flips in odd dimensions. A nontrivial projection collapses at least one direction, so the $n$-volume vanishes and $\det = 0$.

The determinant reappears in the [[inverse via pseudoscalar|coordinate-free inverse formula]] as the normalization factor, and in [[dual representations]] where it scales the transformation law for duals.
