# pseudoscalar

In an $n$-dimensional space, the highest nonzero grade is $n$. Any nonzero $n$-blade represents an oriented $n$-volume element, and the space of $n$-blades $\bigwedge^n \mathbb{R}^n$ is one-dimensional, so any two nonzero pseudoscalars differ by a scalar factor. Fixing a nonzero pseudoscalar $I_n$ therefore fixes an orientation and a volume unit, up to sign and scale.

This “one-dimensional top grade” fact is the reason pseudoscalars keep reappearing.
In Chapter 4, an [[outermorphism]] preserves grade, so it must send $I_n$ to another pseudoscalar, hence to a scalar multiple of $I_n$. That scalar multiple is the [[determinant]].

Once a metric is present, $I_n$ also controls orthogonal complements. Dualization maps a blade $A$ to a complementary blade $A^*$ representing the orthogonal complement, and the definition is given in [[duality and orthogonality]].

The same pattern works inside a subspace. If a [[null and nonnull blades|nonnull]] blade $B$ spans a $b$-dimensional subspace, then $B$ plays the role of the pseudoscalar of that subspace, and [[geometric operations]] uses this “local pseudoscalar” perspective to build orthogonal projection from contraction and $B^{-1}$ (see [[blade inverse]]).
