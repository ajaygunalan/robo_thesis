title: "the 3-d cross product"

In $\mathbb{R}^{3,0}$, with pseudoscalar $I_3$,
$$
a \times b = (a \wedge b)^* = (a \wedge b) \lrcorner I_3^{-1}.
$$
It spans a plane with $\wedge$, then takes its [[duality and orthogonality|orthogonal complement]] (dualizes).

Treating $\times$ as a primitive hides two steps and blocks generalization. If you mean a plane, keep the bivector $x\wedge y$ (it transforms correctly under linear maps). If you need a normal in 3-d, dualize at the end. The intersection use-case is better handled by the general meet construction introduced later. The cross product is the 3-d special case.
