title: "null and nonnull blades"

A blade $A$ is nonnull if its squared norm is nonzero, and null if its squared norm vanishes even though $A\neq 0$. Using the [[scalar product]] and [[reversion]], define
$$
\lVert A\rVert^2 := A\ast \tilde A.
$$
Then $A$ is nonnull iff $\lVert A\rVert^2\neq 0$.

Only nonnull blades admit a [[blade inverse]].

Null blades arise in non-euclidean metrics (indefinite signatures) and in degenerate metrics. Formulas that require $B^{-1}$ (projection, duality with $I_n^{-1}$, local duality inside $B$) must then be replaced by reciprocal-based constructions.
