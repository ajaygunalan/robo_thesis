title: "blade inverse"

In a metric algebra, a blade $A$ is invertible only when it is [[null and nonnull blades|nonnull]]. Using the [[scalar product]] and [[reversion]], define its squared norm by
$$
\lVert A\rVert^2 := A\ast\tilde A.
$$
Invertibility means $\lVert A\rVert^2\neq 0$.

For a [[null and nonnull blades|nonnull]] $k$-blade $A$, a canonical inverse is
$$
A^{-1}=(-1)^{k(k-1)/2}\frac{\tilde A}{\lVert A\rVert^2}.
$$
This choice behaves correctly with [[contraction (⌋)|contraction]]-based identities. Null blades have no inverse and require reciprocal-based replacements.
