#  constructions in euclidean geometry

Chapter 15 is essentially a claim about *language*: once Euclidean primitives (points, planes, spheres, lines, circles) live as blades in the conformal model, you don't "do geometry" by case-bashing anymore—you write expressions and let the algebra manage both the computation *and* the bookkeeping of what kind of geometric thing you're holding.

That language has two complementary verbs. One is incidence—"what's common?"—which becomes a very general operation in [[meet and plunge]]: it intersects arbitrary flats and rounds, sometimes producing real intersections, sometimes imaginary ones, sometimes infinitesimal tangents. The other verb is almost the opposite: "what's perpendicular to all of these?" The chapter's punchline is that the dual of the meet isn't a nuisance; it's a *new primitive construction* (the plunge) that is metric, fast, and shows up everywhere once you learn to see it. And because meet/plunge can swap between real and imaginary results depending on whether the objects truly intersect, the algebra quietly encodes polar relationships that would otherwise take a page of special reasoning.

Once you accept that meet/plunge are the structural backbone, the chapter turns practical: it collects a handful of "nuggets" you will reuse constantly in real code, like tangents without differentiating, carriers and surrounding spheres, clean factorizations of rounds, and even what "affine combinations" really mean in conformal space ([[tangents carriers surrounds and affine combinations]]). These nuggets aren't separate tricks—they're the small, reliable conversions that keep expressions short and geometrically interpretable.

That same viewpoint reframes projection. The familiar geometric-algebra projection formula still exists, but for rounds it can't possibly return conics (an ellipse isn't a blade), so it returns the *round that best matches the orthogonal structure* of the situation. The chapter explains that surprise by tying projection to incidence with a perpendicular "plunge sphere" construction ([[euclidean projections]]).

Then it goes after a chronic source of bugs in classical implementations: "vector" is overloaded. Free direction, plane normal, force-like line vector, tangent-at-a-point, and position-vector-as-point all *must* transform differently under Euclidean motions. In the conformal model they become different algebraic elements acted on by the same rotors/translators, so the "data type management" happens automatically ([[vector types in cga]]).

Finally, the Voronoi-cell example is the proof-by-demonstration: start from just four points and end with a compact, symmetric expression for a Voronoi edge's carrier, endpoint, and signed length—without building a scaffolding of trigonometric variables. The conformal result is not "approximate intuition"; it's an exact coordinate-free formula that *makes the hidden circle test and sign flip emerge naturally* ([[voronoi edge from four points]]).
