# Non-Euclidean Geometries in the Conformal Model

## Geometry selection by "what you keep invariant"

In Euclidean conformal geometry, you insist that $\infty$ remains invariant because it *means* "point at infinity." The chapter's unifying trick is to change that rule: keep a different vector invariant, and you get a different geometry—still inside the same conformal algebra.

- Preserve $\infty$ $\Rightarrow$ Euclidean geometry.
- Preserve the real unit sphere $e = o - \infty/2$ $\Rightarrow$ hyperbolic geometry (Poincaré disk/ball model).
- Preserve the imaginary unit sphere $\bar{e} = o + \infty/2$ $\Rightarrow$ spherical geometry.

## Hyperbolic geometry: $e = o - \infty/2$ plays the role of infinity

If you preserve

$$
e = o - \frac{1}{2}\infty,
$$

then the boundary sphere becomes "infinity," yielding the Poincaré disk (in 2-D) or hyperball (in higher dimensions). The structural consequence is that the special elements that represented Euclidean "flats" by containing $\infty$ are replaced by elements containing $e$. In pictures, hyperbolic lines appear as circles that meet the boundary sphere orthogonally.

Translations also change character. In Euclidean space, translation along a line $L$ is generated using $\infty$; in the hyperbolic model the analogous rotor uses $e$ instead:

$$
\text{hyperbolic translation along } L: \quad \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(e \cdot L)\right).
$$

Because the generator is no longer null the way the Euclidean translation generator is, the induced metric looks distorted in Euclidean coordinates: equal hyperbolic steps "crowd" toward the boundary, and the boundary remains unreachable. Motions preserving $e$ can be generated by vectors of the form $n + \delta e$, letting you build a hyperbolic analogue of the Euclidean versor machinery without rewriting the whole framework.

## Spherical geometry: $\bar{e} = o + \infty/2$ and great circles via stereographic projection

Preserving the imaginary unit sphere

$$
\bar{e} = o + \frac{1}{2}\infty
$$

produces a model of spherical geometry: the geometry on an $n$-sphere where "flats" correspond to great circles (or great hyperspheres). In the 2-D depiction, the blades that play the role of lines are those containing $\bar{e}$; in the plane they appear as circles that intersect the unit circle in **diametrically opposite points**.

This connects cleanly to stereographic projection: the planar picture is the stereographic image of great circles on the sphere, and stereographic projection is conformal because it can be realized as an inversion in a sphere of radius $\sqrt{2}$ with an appropriate center (south pole description in the text). In this model, a "flat point" $p \wedge \bar{e}$ is not a single point but a point pair representing antipodal points on the sphere.

Here, "translations" become rotations on the sphere, and the natural distance becomes an angular measure (angle between great circles), again generated by versors built from reflections in vectors of the form $n + \delta\bar{e}$.
