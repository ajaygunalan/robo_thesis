# Transversion

## The definition: inversion–translation–inversion

Classical conformal geometry highlights an operation called a **transversion**. In conformal GA it has a strikingly compact rotor form because it is built from three familiar moves:

1. invert in the unit sphere,
2. translate,
3. invert again in the unit sphere.

If $\sigma = o - \infty/2$ is the dual unit sphere at the origin and $T_t = 1 - \frac{1}{2}t\infty$ is the translation versor, then the triple composition simplifies to

$$
\sigma T_t \sigma = 1 + o \, t.
$$

Even better, this has an exponential form:

$$
1 + o \, t = \exp(o \, t).
$$

The two inversions make the overall operation **handedness-preserving**, so transversions are proper conformal transformations represented by an **even versor that is a rotor**.

## Why it matters: it completes the primitive rotor vocabulary

Translations, rotations, and scalings each "use up" a characteristic bivector flavor of the conformal model. Transversion is the remaining natural primitive: its generator lives in the $o$–Euclidean direction sector rather than the $\infty$–Euclidean sector (translation) or the $o$–$\infty$ sector (scaling). Put differently, if you look at the bivector basis ingredients the conformal model makes available, transversion is the one you hadn't named yet—until now.

## A geometric alternative: touching spheres

The chapter also points out an analogy with Euclidean rotation: just as a rotation can be built from reflections in two planes meeting along a line, a transversion can be realized (up to standardization choices) by reflecting in **two spheres that touch at a point**. The "inversion–translation–inversion" definition is algebraically convenient; the "touching spheres" definition is geometrically memorable.
