# General Conformal Transformations

## Versors really do generate the conformal group

Once you have reflections (in planes, spheres) and the full suite of primitive rotors (including transversion), you can build **any conformal transformation** as a product of the model's elementary vectors—so the conformal model finally earns its name in a very literal algebraic sense. The chapter emphasizes a practical habit: keep computations in versor form as long as possible, because the same sandwiching mechanism transforms *any* blade cleanly, while explicit coordinate formulas quickly become case-dependent and error-prone.

## Loxodromic transformations: a single rotor that blends "everything"

A particularly vivid example is the **loxodromic rotor**

$$
L = \exp\big(o \wedge e_1 - e_2 \wedge \infty\big).
$$

Applied repeatedly (or applied in fractional powers to show its action smoothly), it maps a circle into a sequence of circles tracing a loxodrome-like flow: there is a "source" and "sink," and the motion between them is an elegant blend of scaling, rotation, and translation. The point is not the specific picture; it's that CGA lets you apply such a rotor to *any* geometric primitive (circles, lines, spheres, etc.) with no new machinery, and the construction is not confined to 2-D—the same rotor expression extends to n-D space.

## Circular rotations: orbits around a circle, not a line

The chapter also highlights **circular rotations**, whose orbits curve around a circle $K$ rather than around a straight axis line. These are generated by rotors of the form $\exp(K^*)$. The orbit geometry becomes concrete in the identity that the object built from a point $p$ and the generator $K^*$,

$$
p \wedge K^*,
$$

is itself a circle: the motion "rules" space by circles that wrap around $K$. This gives a compact way to generate objects like tori from small sets of generator curves, and suggests a modeling advantage: circles can be treated as first-class "sweep primitives," not as approximations to be discretized into points.

## Möbius transformations: a familiar 2-D story, and its limit

Classically (especially in 2-D), conformal maps are taught as Möbius transformations

$$
z \mapsto \frac{az + b}{cz + d},
$$

with a $2 \times 2$ complex matrix representation that makes composition easy. The chapter's stance is blunt: this is clever, but it is point-centric and fundamentally tied to complex numbers, hence to 2-D. The conformal GA approach keeps the same compositional simplicity (products of versors) while remaining n-D and while acting uniformly on higher-grade objects (lines, circles, spheres) rather than only on points.

## A boundary: no general closed-form log once transversion participates freely

The chapter explicitly notes a limitation: while you can get a closed-form logarithm for positively scaled rigid body motions (TRS), a closed-form logarithm for a fully general conformal transformation that includes an arbitrary transversion component is not known here. That marks the edge of "interpolate by log/exp in closed form" inside this treatment.
