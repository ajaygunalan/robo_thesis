The homogeneous model did something valuable: it made Euclidean transformations easy to *apply*. But it never really made Euclidean geometry easy to *compute*, because the metric living inside the model wasn't the Euclidean metric you actually cared about. Chapter 13's move is blunt and decisive: rebuild the model so that Euclidean distance becomes native, not an afterthought. You get there by changing the representational space itself—two extra dimensions, an indefinite metric, and a point at infinity that "closes" Euclidean space in exactly the way classical geometers have wanted for centuries. That entire interface—what the extra dimensions mean, why points must be null, and how squared distance becomes an inner product—lives in [[conformal representational space]].

Once distance is literally encoded as an inner product, Euclidean isometries stop being "affine tricks" and become what they always were: transformations that preserve an inner product. In a geometric algebra, that means orthogonal transformations, and orthogonal transformations mean versors. That's the chapter's operational punchline: if your motions are versors, then every construction you express in geometric algebra automatically moves correctly—no separate "transform the object, then transform the auxiliary data, then re-normalize" bookkeeping. The precise condition that makes a versor genuinely "Euclidean" in this model, plus the concrete rotors for translations and rotations and the reason structure-preservation becomes automatic, is the spine of [[euclidean transformations as versors]].

The model would be a curiosity if it only moved points around. The surprise is what the *rest* of the representational vectors mean: in this metric, generic vectors aren't "just directions"; they become dual spheres, with planes and points as limiting cases. In other words, by fixing distance properly you accidentally buy a native algebra of spheres. That change in what vectors *are* is not a side detail—it's the reason so many geometric statements suddenly become uniform. That interpretive shift is part of [[conformal representational space]], and it's the reason later chapters can treat circles, spheres, tangencies, and intersections with the same algebraic grammar.

But Chapter 13 doesn't jump straight into "everything is a sphere." It first reconnects you to familiar Euclidean workhorses—lines, planes, and directions—by showing how the homogeneous model is embedded inside the conformal one as the sub-world of blades carrying a factor of $\infty$. Flats become simple outer-product objects again, except now they live in a model where translations are versors (so the metric doesn't break when you move things). That entire bridge—direct/dual flats, direction elements, and the clean correspondence with homogeneous points and lines—sits in [[flats and directions]].

With that foundation, classical formulas start upgrading themselves. The clean demonstration is reflection: in old-school linear algebra you reflect a direction, then separately reconstruct a line from a point plus that direction. In the conformal model you don't do any of that—just reflect the *whole* line (or plane, or any flat) by a single sandwiching expression, and the location+orientation coherence is guaranteed by the versor structure. The "one formula, no case splits" reflection story (and its differential variant when the mirror moves) is [[general planar reflection]].

Finally, the chapter leans into rigid body motion as the real-world payoff. If translations and rotations are both rotors, you can take logarithms, extract screw parameters (Chasles) without drowning in trigonometry, and interpolate motions in a way that's algebraically natural and geometrically faithful. This is where "operational Euclidean geometry" stops being a slogan and becomes a pipeline: represent motion → take $\log$ → scale → $\exp$ → apply. The screw decomposition, the closed-form log, and the interpolation recipe live in [[screw motions and rigid body motion logarithm]].
