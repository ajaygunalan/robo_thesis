Reversion $\tilde{\cdot}$ reverses the order of vectors inside each blade:
$$
\widetilde{a_1\wedge\cdots\wedge a_k}=a_k\wedge\cdots\wedge a_1.
$$
On a $k$-blade this reversal contributes the sign $(-1)^{k(k-1)/2}$. Reversion is the involution that appears in norms such as $A\ast\tilde A$ and in identities relating left/right contractions.
