The conformal model starts to feel "complete" when you stop treating Euclidean geometry as "points + lines + planes" and instead treat *all of Euclid's objects* as algebraic primitives you can meet, join, move, and measure with the same few products. This chapter is that expansion: beyond flats/directions, the model's blades naturally encode spheres, circles, point pairs, and even tangents as first-class computational objects, so you don't have to switch representations or invent special-case data structures when your geometry stops being flat.

The story begins with the clean split the conformal model gives you: objects that "go through infinity" behave like flats, while objects built from finite points behave like rounds. The quickest way to internalize this is to learn both a parameter-driven encoding and an incidence-driven encoding of the same geometry: build a round from center/radius in the *dual* picture, or build it from incident points in the *direct* picture. Those are two faces of one thing, and you get to pick whichever face matches your data. That dual-first route is the gateway drug in [[dual rounds]]; the point-wedge route is the complementary viewpoint in [[direct rounds and orientation]].

Once rounds are available, the next surprise is that "radius $=0$" is not a degenerate failure mode—it's a new geometric primitive. When two rounds touch, their intersection is not a point but a *tangent blade* with location and direction baked in, sitting right inside the same algebra. That's what [[tangents]] is about: tangency appears through incidence, not limits, and you can manipulate these "small-but-weighted" elements just like any other blade.

Of course, if your computations can output *any* blade, you must be able to interpret what you got: Is it a flat? a round? a tangent? real or imaginary? where is it, what direction does it carry, what is its size? The chapter's big practical table is really a classification-and-decoding API, and [[from blades to parameters]] distills how to do that without relying on coordinates or casework.

If any of this still feels like magic—"how can a linear blade represent a circle?"—the geometric intuition comes from a picture: conformal points live on a paraboloid in an extra $\infty$-direction, and duality turns into "tangent/polar plane" geometry. In that lifted space, circle intersection becomes plane intersection; roundness becomes flatness one dimension up. That's the core mental model in [[paraboloid intuition for rounds]].

And then the payoff: once circles/spheres/tangents are linear algebra objects in disguise, classical "clever tricks" become routine. Voronoi/Delaunay via paraboloid lifting is just conformal geometry seen without the metric; sphere fitting drops into an SVD; kinematics becomes rotor chaining that moves *any* primitive, not just points. Those algorithmic consequences are collected in [[applications of conformal primitives]].
