# offset models

Chapter 5 treats only subspaces through the origin, where blades directly represent homogeneous subspaces. Many geometric problems involve offset objects (parallelism, skewness, distances), and those require an embedding that turns “offset” into “through the origin” in a higher-dimensional space.

In the homogeneous model (one extra dimension), an offset $k$-flat in Euclidean space becomes a blade in the model space. In that setting, meet/join can represent intersections of offset subspaces: parallel lines have a finite meet, and skew lines can meet in a scalar that is proportional to their orthogonal Euclidean distance when interpreted back in Euclidean terms.

In the conformal model, the same meet/join machinery applies to spheres, circles, lines, and planes represented as blades in a higher-dimensional space with a degenerate metric. The operational reuse is enabled by the join-relative dual viewpoint of [[meet from join]] together with the nonmetric, transformation-invariant nature of meet/join in [[linear transformation invariance]].
