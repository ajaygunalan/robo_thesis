# orthogonal transformations as versors

This chapter is the moment geometric algebra stops looking like "vector algebra with extra parts" and starts acting like an operator calculus for Euclidean (and later, non-Euclidean) geometry.

It begins with the observation that the "sandwiching" construction isn't a cute trick from the previous chapter; it's the native language for orthogonal operators. A mirror is not a matrix; it's a blade (or vector) used as an operator, and the operational core is laid out in [[sandwich reflections]].

Once reflections are operators, rotations become inevitable: any rotation is an even number of reflections, so it is generated by an even product of vectors. Normalizing that product gives the chapter's workhorse, the [[rotor sandwiching]]—an element that you apply uniformly to vectors, bivectors, planes, and in fact any grade, without swapping representations or rebuilding coordinate frames.

With rotors in hand, "composition" stops being a special case: you just multiply the operators. The chapter uses this to connect three things that are usually taught as unrelated: planar complex multiplication, quaternion multiplication, and 3-D rotation composition geometry. Those connections—and the surprisingly tangible spherical-arc picture that makes quaternion products feel less mystical—are the spine of [[rotor composition]].

Parameterizing rotations by "two vectors" is intuitive, but it's not always the most direct interface for geometry problems. The chapter then switches perspective: instead of building rotors as products, build them as exponentials of bivectors (and learn what changes in non-Euclidean signatures). That move—[[bivector exponentials]]—isn't just notational elegance; it's what later makes translations and scalings appear as the same kind of object (versor actions) in conformal models.

At this point, the distinction between "a subspace" and "an operator" starts to blur in a productive way: subspaces generate reflections; products of those reflections generate every orthogonal map; and, crucially, these maps preserve the algebraic structure of geometry (inner/outer/geometric products, meets/joins where defined, and even exponentials). That is the conceptual payload of [[versors preserve structure]]: versors are not merely a representation of orthogonal transformations—they are *how* the geometric product earns its name as "operator multiplication."

The chapter closes by zooming out: it argues (deliberately provocatively) for a "multiplicative principle" view of geometric algebra, contrasting it with the more permissive Clifford-algebra habit of freely adding multivectors without geometric intent. And because none of this matters if it's unusably slow, it also sketches the real computational tradeoffs and why practical implementations lean on specialization and code generation. Those themes—philosophical and pragmatic—live in [[multiplicative principle and cost]].
